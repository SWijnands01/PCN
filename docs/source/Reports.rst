1. On the page itself, there are different categories: 
    a. Quality
      This means that reports are generated by patient. 
      
    b. Statistics
      This means that reports are generated by visit. There are several different options that you can generate reports about:
         * Actions/procedures performed at visit.
         * Discordance (when the treatment recommendation is overridden at a visit).
         * Iatrogenic events (when complex clubfeet are noted at visit).
         * Relapse (when a relapse is noted at a visit).
         * Adverse observations (when noted at visit treatment).
