Beneath the visit summary, you can see the recommended treatment. If you want to change the treatment, you can manually do so by clicking the arrow on the right. A drop-down menu opens with all the possible treatments listed. The recommended treatment by PCN has an asterisk next to it (sometimes there are more treatments that are recommended, but by default PCN shows the most recommended treatment). If you change the treatment manually, you will **always** have to give a reason (this field will pop-up).

Below the recommended treatment, you can see the duration of the treatment. You can manually adapt the duration (if the logistics work better in your hospital for example) by clicking on the arrows on the right side of the field or to remove the number and enter it manually.
