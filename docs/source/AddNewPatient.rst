   - **Sex:**   
   Make sure the sex is filled in. This is a multiple choice question, so you can choose either one of the answers.  
   
   - **Date of birth:** 
   Make sure the date of birth is filled in. You can do this by either filling in the date manually (depending on the format of your device, this is mm/dd/yy or dd/mm/yy), or clicking on the little calendar on the right side and clicking on the date of birth. 
   
   - **Patient id:**   
   This is a code for the patient, used by PCN. The code should be unique (meaning that there is no other patient in PCN stored under the same code), otherwise PCN will not accept it.  
      - Best practice: use the alphabet and numbers for your code, and avoid special characters or white spaces. 
      - For example: Your initials and a number (AA001)
      
   - **Phone number:** 
   Make sure you fill in at least one number in the phone number.
