How can you generate reports ?

1. On the page itself, there are different categories: 
a. Quality
b. Statistics 
1. You can choose one of the categories/subcategories and select it. After clicking the link, you will be redirected to the specific reports page. In this example, we took the 'Laterality' report. The page will look like this:

      :scale: 80 % 



2. On the top of the page, you can see a subheading called 'Filters'. In this part, you can filter the data based on:
- the date: select the start date and end date via the calendar icon on the right side
- the clinic: select the clinic that you work for in the drop-down menu. 
*Sidenote: the clinic that you work for is automatically selected

3. When you entered the filters, you can click on the red 'Filter' button below. 


4. There is another button below the subheading 'Filters': 'Export csv'. When you click on this button, the report is exported in a .csv format. 


5. There is another subheading below called 'Results'. Here you see the results from the specific report (with additional filters). It is shown as a bar graph over the different months. There is an option above the bar graph to have a different visualisation of the data
- Total patients per month: it only includes data of patients (sides are not shown). An example of what the graph looks like is shown below:

- Patients per affected sides per month: the data is separated for the different sides. An example of what the graph looks like is shown below:

6. Below the bar graph, a more elaborate table with specific information about the numbers shown in the graph is shown.
