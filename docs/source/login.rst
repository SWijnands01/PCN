----------------


1.	Go to the app (https://pcnred.herokuapp.com/clft/) 
2.	Enter your username and password
3.	Select the clinic from the dropdown menu
      Sidenote: selecting the right clinic is important, as the logistics per clinic are different and thereby affect the algorithm behind the app!
4.	Click the “Login” button
