General information
------------
In this part of the manual, different screens from PCN are explained step-by-step. First of all, it is important to understand how the screens in PCN are build up. There are two types of screens included in PCN:

      **- Summary screens**
          This type of screen gives a summary of previously filled in data. You do not have to fill in anything or undertake any action for this type of screen. An                 example of a summary screen can be seen below:

             :scale: 80 %
             
          
      **- Activity screens**
          This type of screen, you need to enter information or perform a certain action. There are several types of activity screens:
            - An activity screen with one attribute: this is a more general screen. You will only need to fill in information of the patient in general. It is **not**               specific for a foot. Below you can find an example of such a screen:
            
            .. image:: images/GeneralExam.JPG
             :scale: 80 %
            
            
            - An activity screen with two attributes: in this type of screen, you need to switch between the left foot and the right foot. You will get a screen in                   which you need to fill in information for one side, and then you continue to the other side, where you need to fill in the information as well before                   saving the information. Below you can find an example of such a screen:
            
            .. image:: images/ClubfootHistory_1.JPG
             :scale: 80 %
